# PS4 Auto Jailbreak By MINA ADEL - Version 2.2.0

## Overview

This project is an automatic PS4 9.00 jailbreak that uses PSFree and Lapse to load GoldHEN v2.4b18.4. It provides a simple and reliable way to jailbreak your PS4 console running firmware 9.00.

## New Improvements

1. **Stability Enhancement**: Added delay before payload loading to improve jailbreak stability and reduce the likelihood of freezes or restarts.

2. **Advanced Memory Management System**: Developed an integrated memory management system that includes:
   - Memory Stabilizer module to prevent memory leaks
   - Exploit Stabilizer module to enhance memory stability during exploit execution
   - PS4 Memory Helper module to optimize PS4 browser performance and reduce memory consumption
   - Periodic memory cleanup mechanism to ensure system stability

3. **GoldHEN Version Fix**: Added a mechanism to fix the incorrect GoldHEN version display (2.4b18.3 instead of 2.4b18.4).

4. **Payload Validation**: Added validation for the payload to ensure it's properly loaded before execution.

5. **UI Improvements**: Enhanced user interface with better status messages and visual feedback.

6. **Code Organization**: Improved code structure and organization for better maintainability.

## How to Use

1. Open the internet browser on your PS4 with firmware 9.00.
2. Go to the website hosting these files: https://minaadel551.github.io/test/
3. The page will be automatically cached in the browser.
4. PSFree and Lapse exploits will run automatically.
5. GoldHEN v2.4b18.4 will be loaded and executed automatically.

## Important Notes

- This project has been tested only on firmware 9.00.
- The Advanced Memory Management System consists of three integrated modules to achieve maximum stability:
  - **Memory Stabilizer**: Prevents memory leaks and improves object management in memory
  - **Exploit Stabilizer**: Prepares memory before exploit execution and cleans it up afterward
  - **PS4 Memory Helper**: Optimizes PS4 browser performance and reduces memory consumption
- A periodic memory cleanup mechanism works in the background to ensure system stability during and after the jailbreak process
- The likelihood of freezes or restarts has been significantly reduced compared to previous versions
- The likelihood of in-game issues is much lower thanks to the Advanced Memory Management System
- Use this project at your own risk.
