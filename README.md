# PS4 Auto Jailbreak By MINA ADEL - Version 2.2.0



## Overview

This project is an automatic PS4 9.00 jailbreak that uses PSFree and Lapse to load GoldHEN v2.4b18.4. It provides a simple and reliable way to jailbreak your PS4 console running firmware 9.00.

## New Improvements

1. **Stability Enhancement**: Added delay before payload loading to improve jailbreak stability and reduce the likelihood of freezes or restarts.

2. **Advanced Memory Management System**: Developed an integrated memory management system that includes:

   * Memory Stabilizer module to prevent memory leaks

   * Exploit Stabilizer module to enhance memory stability during exploit execution

   * PS4 Memory Helper module to optimize PS4 browser performance and reduce memory consumption

   * Periodic memory cleanup mechanism to ensure system stability

3. **Payload Validation**: Added validation for the payload to ensure it's properly loaded before execution.

4. **UI Improvements**: Enhanced user interface with better status messages and visual feedback.

5. **Code Organization**: Improved code structure and organization for better maintainability.

Key Features:

üéØ Firmware Support: PS4 9.00 (99% stability rate)

üîó Kernel Access: Integrated Lapse kernel exploit for full system access

üì± Web-based: Runs directly in the PS4 browser - no additional tools required

üíæ Offline Cache: Built-in caching system for reliable offline usage

## How to Use

1. Open the internet browser on your PS4 with firmware 9.00.

2. Go to the host [website](https://minaadel551.github.io/ps4host/).

3. The page will be automatically cached in the browser.

4. PSFree and Lapse exploits will run automatically.

5. GoldHEN will be loaded and executed automatically.

## Important Notes

* This project has been tested only on firmware 9.00.

* The Advanced Memory Management System consists of three integrated modules to achieve maximum stability:

  * **Memory Stabilizer**: Prevents memory leaks and improves object management in memory

  * **Exploit Stabilizer**: Prepares memory before exploit execution and cleans it up afterward

  * **PS4 Memory Helper**: Optimizes PS4 browser performance and reduces memory consumption

* A periodic memory cleanup mechanism works in the background to ensure system stability during and after the jailbreak process

* The likelihood of freezes or restarts has been significantly reduced compared to previous versions

* The likelihood of in-game issues is much lower thanks to the Advanced Memory Management System

* Use this project at your own risk.
